## Project Overview

The **IoT Protocols Documentation project** focuses on creating a comprehensive and structured reference for communication protocols widely used in Internet of Things (IoT) systems. As connected devices become increasingly prevalent across industries—from smart homes and healthcare to agriculture and manufacturing—the need for seamless communication between heterogeneous devices has become critical.

This project details key IoT protocols such as MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, and LoRaWAN, each tailored for different performance metrics including power efficiency, data rate, range, reliability, and scalability.

The documentation explains architectural structure, data exchange models, and protocol-specific mechanisms. It provides comparative insights into strengths and weaknesses of protocols to help engineers select the most suitable communication method for applications ranging from low-power sensor networks to real-time industrial control systems.

## Internet of Things (IoT)

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity. These systems enable seamless communication between people, processes, and machines using cloud computing, data analytics, and real-time monitoring.

## OSI Model

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)** model divides network communication into seven layers:

1. **Physical Layer** – Hardware transmission (cables, RF, fiber)  
2. **Data Link Layer** – Node-to-node communication and error detection  
3. **Network Layer** – Routing and addressing (IP)  
4. **Transport Layer** – Reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP)  
5. **Session Layer** – Session management  
6. **Presentation Layer** – Encryption, compression, data translation  
7. **Application Layer** – End-user protocols (HTTP, MQTT, etc.)  

---

## IoT Architecture Layers

- **Perception Layer** → Sensors & Data Acquisition  
- **Network Layer** → Wi-Fi / BLE / LoRa Communication  
- **Processing Layer** → Edge/Gateway/Cloud Data Processing  
- **Application Layer** → Monitoring & Control Systems

## Industrial IoT Communication Protocols

### Fieldbus Protocols

**MODBUS RTU** – Serial-based industrial communication protocol widely used in automation and SCADA systems.  
**PROFIBUS** – High-speed industrial fieldbus for PLC and automation networks.  
**CANOPEN** – Industrial protocol based on CAN bus used in embedded and automation systems.  
**DEVICENET** – Industrial device-level communication based on CAN technology.  
**SERCOS** – Real-time communication protocol for motion control and robotics.

### Industrial Ethernet Protocols

**PROFINET** – Industrial Ethernet standard for automation and real-time control.  
**MODBUS TCP/IP** – Ethernet-based Modbus communication used in SCADA and monitoring systems.  
**ETHERCAT** – Ultra-fast real-time industrial Ethernet protocol for automation.  
**ETHERNET/IP** – Industrial communication based on standard Ethernet and TCP/IP.  
**POWERLINK** – Real-time Ethernet communication used in industrial automation.

These protocols enable **deterministic communication, high reliability, and real-time industrial control**.
