## Portfolio Notice

This repository is created strictly for **portfolio and recruiter evaluation**.  
It provides engineering-level documentation and analysis of IoT communication protocols used in embedded and connected systems.

This repository contains **technical documentation only**, not production firmware.

---

## Project Overview

This project presents an **engineering-level study and comparison of IoT communication protocols** used in embedded, industrial, and connected systems. The goal is to understand protocol selection based on power, bandwidth, latency, reliability, scalability, and system architecture requirements.

The knowledge presented here is based on practical exposure to IoT and embedded system development during my tenure at **Central Manufacturing Technology Institute (CMTI)**.

## Application Layer Protocols

- **HTTP** – Web-based communication and REST APIs  
- **CoAP** – Lightweight REST protocol for constrained devices  
- **MQTT** – Publish–subscribe protocol for IoT monitoring  
- **AMQP** – Reliable enterprise-grade messaging protocol  
- **DDS** – Real-time, high-performance distributed communication  
- **SOAP** – XML-based structured messaging protocol  
- **XMPP** – Real-time messaging and device communication  
- **LoRaWAN** – Long-range, low-power wireless IoT communication
